This way, the only thing the user has to do is copy the word, and a notification will pop up with the definition.\r\nA click on the notification will present other definitions.\r\n\r\nThere's also the option for a more tradiotional approach where you can simply open the app and look for the word you're looking for in a clean and direct design.\r\n\r\nSince it's based on the Wiktionary's API, it supports dozens of languages in a 2MB app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###### TODO\r\n- Add German language;\r\n- Offline option;\r\n\r\n\r\n[You can check it out on Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.bar.dictionary.wiki.dictionarybar)\r\n","google":"UA-38018123-18","note":"Don't delete this file!
